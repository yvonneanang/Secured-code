        <h1>The Natural World</h1>
        <p>From forests to oceans, the sky to the soil, nature has long provided us with everything we need to live. While we have made things a bit more comfortable for ourselves, we are still finding eays that nature can help us live longer, healthier lives.</p>
        <p>Did you know: over 3, 000 years ago, ancient Egyptians used willow bark and myrtle to reduce pain and fever? This is still used today, it's call Aspirin!</p>
        
        <h2>THE SUN AND THE EARTH</h2>
        <p>The brightest star in the sky is the Sun, also known as "Sol", which is why we call it and the planets around it the Solar System. Energy from the Sun (in the form of sunlight and heat) warms the Earth and helps plants frow. Without it, we wouldn't be able to live on earth at all.</p>
        <p>We live on Earth, sometimes called "The blue planet" because it looks blue from space. Earth is the only planet in the Solar system that can support life naturally. We might be able to live on other planets one day, but we'll have to make a lot of changes to them first!</p>
        
        <h2>EARTH</h2>
        <p>Earth is the third closest planet  to the Sun, and the fifth largest. It is small and rocky, with lots of different geographical features, such as moountains, evergreen forests, rainforests, plains, deserts, valleys and, of course, oceans!</p>
        
        <h2>UNKNOWN WORLD</h2>
        <p>Up until the twentieth century we had no complete maps of the planet. We then began to take pictures of Earth from space. Tji s allowed us to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the world. Pictures from space also help us predict the weather, and are especially useful in showing where hurricanes and other storms are heading.</p>
        <p>Thanks to these pictures we can also understand why temperatures vary so much based on seasons.</p>
        
        <h2>MOVING PLANET</h2>
        <p>Every year the Earth makes one rotation of the Sun. Each Earth year is divided into <strong>four seasons</strong>. As Earth revolves around the Sun, parts of it are closer to it in the warmer months, and further away in the colder ones. That's what gives us seasons.</p>
        <p>DO YOU KNOW? The changing seasons on Earth are caused by its position relative to the Sun.</p>
        
        <h2>WILD WEATHER</h2>
        <p>While our weather follows the basic pattern of the seasons, it can vary a lot. Weather happens when the differences in temperature around the planet cause the air to move.</p>
        
        <h2>WHY DOES WEATHER HAPPEN?</h2>
        <p>The differences in <strong>temperature</strong> around the planet mean air is constantly moving. Warm air in one place rises above cooler air, and the cooler air swirls in. IN other places, cool air sinks and pushes warmer air out. Huge "air masses", or bodies of air, carrying wet, dry, hot or cold air, are moved along by the wind. When two air masses meet, we get a "front", and the weather changes.</p>
        
        <h2>HURRICANES AND CYCLONS</h2>
        <p><strong>Wet, Wild and Windy</strong></p>
        <p>Another thing that can happen when hot and cold air meet is a <strong>tropical storm</strong>. This can be called a <strong>Cyclone,</strong> a <strong>Typhon</strong>, or a <strong>Hurricane</strong>. Generally, Typhoons start over water, while cyclones and hurricanes can start on land. They are all caused by the same meeting of hot and cold air generating winds of more than 250km/h (faster the top speed of most cars on the road).</p>
        
        <h2>WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE</h2>
        <p>One of the most important parts of the natural world is water. Even in the desert, water can be found in the air at night or deep underground. Without it, not much can survive. Water follows a cycle where it is turned into steam by heat to form clouds. Clouds cool down and form rain, which becomes water on the ground and the whole cycle starts again.</p>
        
        <h2>SPECTACULAR VOLCANOES</h2>
        <p>Volcanoes are formed when molten rock from inside the Earth is forced out through a mountain formed through a build up of pressure.</p>
        <p>There are more than <strong>500 active volcanoes</strong> in the world. More than half of these volcanoes are part of the "Ring of Fire", a region that circles the edge of the Pacific Ocean, all the way from Chile, up through North America, down past Russia and Japan, around the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, then over to New Zealand.</p>
        
        <h2>DIFFERENT CLIMATES</h2>
        <p>There are five main types of climates in the natural world. Each one has its own environment, species of plant and animal life and amazing things to see. You might have seen more than one type of climate, or even have experienced all of them, but there is always something more to discover. </p>
        
        <h3>CLIMATE ZONES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Polar</li>
            <li>Cool forest</li>
            <li>Temperate</li>
            <li>Desert</li>
            <li>Tropical</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>POLAR</h3>
        <p>Near the North and South poles, its either cold or extremely cold, with lots of snow and ice.</p>
        
        <h3>TROPICAL</h3>
        <p>Hot, humid and full of plant and animal life. This sums up tropical climate.From jungles to marshlands, you'll be surrounded by green.</p>
        
        <h3>COOL FOREST</h3>
        <p>Around here, it's still quite fresh, and there is usually snow in the winter, but it has a lot of evergreen forests and lots of people choose to live in this climate.</p>
        
        <h3>TEMPERATE</h3>
        <p>Warm summers and cool winters are typical here. It can be cool or warm but not too extreme. It's a popular place to live. </p>
        
        <h3>DESERT</h3>
        <p>With very little rainfall, deserts are dry and hot, but at night they can be freezing. There are still quite a few types of animals and plants found there though.</p>
        
        <h2>POLAR</h2>
        <h3>WHAT IS A POLAR CLIMATE?</h3>
        <p>Polar climates are areas that are very cold found near the <strong>North</strong> and <strong>South Poles.</strong> There is usually ice and snow all year round.</p>
        <p><strong>Canada, Russia, Greenland and Antartica</strong> are the main Polar areas on planet Earth.</p>
        
        <h3>WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?</h3>
        <p>Polar regions are very cold, frosty and icy places. It loooks like winter, only it lasts all year round. Great if you like to ski or snowboard, not do good if you want to go for a swim.</p>
        
        <h3>WHAT PLANTS ARE THERE?</h3>
        <p>Not a lot of plants grow in these areas, beacause it's so cold. You might see trees and grass growing at the edge of polar areas - these are important for lots of wildlife, because they provide food, shelter and places to hide.</p>
