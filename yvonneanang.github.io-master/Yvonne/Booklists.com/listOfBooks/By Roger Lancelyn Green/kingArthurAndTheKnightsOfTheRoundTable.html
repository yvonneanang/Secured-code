        <h3><u>About King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table</u></h3>
        <p>After Uther Pendragon's death, Merlin the druid, forms a stone and in it a sword. On this sword is written that anyone who could pull it out of the stone would be the new king of England. After many years, the young Arthur, the secretly son of Pendragon, pulls this magical sword out of the stone, so he is the new king of England. Together with Merlin he built   makes a round table, where only the best knights of England should sit there. So more and more knights come to be a knight of the table, and each of them has his own adventures.</p> 
        <p>After many years the last knight comes to the court of Arthur, to Camelot. The holy knight Sir Galahad, the son of Sir Lancelot. With his coming all knights ride around whole Europe for the search of the holy grail of Jesus Christ. Only four knights see the grail: Sir Lancelot, Sir Parcivale, Sir Bors de Gannis and Sir Galahad.</p> 
        <p>After the grail is found the last battle is near for the round table. In this battle many knights die and with them King Arthur, his nephew Sir Gawain and also the wicked son of King Arthur and his sister Morgana le Fay, Mordred.</p>
        <p>King Arthur is buried at Avalon, the secret island of the druids and damsels.</p>
